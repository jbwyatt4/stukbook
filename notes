changed navbar default and forced it to stay ontop
navbar-inverse
navbar-fixed-top

this causes navbar to be imposed over the main page, fix with css rule
app/assets/stylesheets/pages.css.scss (what? use application.css.scss)
body {
  padding-top: 70px;
}

flash
stretches across screen, below css moves into a box that overlays itself (with z-index: 1) atop of everything and looks terrible.
<% flash.each do |type, message| %>
  <div class="alert alert-info fade-in">
    <button class="close" data-dismiss="alert">x</button>
    <%= message %>
  </div>
<% end %>

.alert {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  width: 200px;
}

put css into application css instead of show css

use a container tag everytime you want to shrink the borders
